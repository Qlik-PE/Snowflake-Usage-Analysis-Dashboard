This version focuses on usage of the Qlik Product family with Data
Integration and Data Analytics analysis (this can be adapted to any
additional query tools)

What’s new in Snowflake Dashboard (V3):

This Qlik Sense app combines data from multiple Snowflake tables to
create an understanding of four key areas.

\- Cost / Usage Analysis: What is the cost of your usage?

-Auditing/ Security: Who is driving usage?

\- Performance & Optimization: Which queries are driving usage?

\- Connection Details: Which Qlik products are driving your usage?

Also, we have created a TOC and Configuration page to set variables
specific to your Snowflake configuration.
