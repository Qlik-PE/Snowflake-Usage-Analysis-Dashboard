# Snowflake Usage and Metadata Dashboard:

This Qlik Sense app combines data from multiple Snowflake tables to
create an understanding of three key areas.

\- Cost / Usage Analysis: There are two versions of this focused on
pay-as-you go models or Enterprise credit purchases.

\- Auditing / Security: Show who is logging in from where (GeoAnalytics)
and metrics associated with Security and Connectivity.

\- Performance & Optimization: Who is running queries, where are their
issues - how does this relate to cost and usage?

Instructions and descriptions are below. Here is a video showing the dashboard in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cNBdX9hufs
